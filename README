Wellcome to the Vector Program README!

First of all say that it were one of my first programs and projects.

This project it's writed in Python, that awesome language.

The GUI it's builded in TKinter, so, you will need that library :)

You will need the library math, but it comes with python, so it wouldn't be a problem.

-------------------------

I know, that there is a lot of programs with the functions I give, but
almost they are so dificult.

With this program, I want to give to the students or professionals, a fast
tool to operate with two tridimensional vectors (or bidimensional, putting the last one 0).

You just have to execute it, put the vectors, and push the button, you will have solutions fast.

Why someone would want that?

It's simple, the idea comes from the GNU/Linux system, the idea it's to have so many tools,
that tools are simple, but makes his work really nice, think about a shell command, concatenate
with pipes, you are just using a lot of little programs, but every little program makes what it should do.

So...

Nothing more, feel free to upgrade that tool :)

------------------------

Have a nice operates!
